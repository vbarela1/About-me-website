    <h3>1980-99</h3>
      <p>I was born and raised in Salt Lake City, Utah.  I moved aournd a lot as a child and went to 7 different elementry schools.  Luckily, during my middle school and high school years, I remained in one area of West Valley City.  I grew up in poverty, but that only helped to mold me into the person I am today. I realized at a young age that education was the key to imporve my life, and I have been an advocate of life long learning ever since.</p>
    <h3>2000-2009</h3>
      <p>In my twenties, I completd a BA in political science, and thought I wanted to go to law school. I changed my mind and moved to New York City. After a year I decided to move to Peru, and this led me to Colombia, Argentina, and Thailand to teach English. This was a completly differnt kind of education that I recieved fromt these experiences, which are invaluable to me. </p>
    <h3>2010-Present</h3>
      <p>So far in my thirties I have completed a masters degree in teaching, moved to the UAE to teach, met my husband, and am now embarking on this adventure of a new career path. So far, my thirties have been the best decade of my life!</p>
