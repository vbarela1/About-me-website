     <h3>Meditation</h3>
      <p>I became interested in meditation when I lived in Thailand.  I attended a ten day silent meditation retreat, and have been an avid practicer ever since.  I find meditation to be a great way to relieve stress, anxiety, and tension.</p>

    <h3>Yoga</h3>
      <p>I am also interested in the benefits from yoga.  It has also helped me to relieve stress and anxiety, as well as helping my body to become more flexible and less stiff. I have been able to do things with my body that I never thoguht I could do before. I hope that I can still do a headstand when I'm 60 years old.</p>

    <h3>Jewelry Making</h3>
      <p>Jewelry making is a new hobby I started a few months ago.  I enjoy creating things with my hands, and have admired many different styles of jewelry throughout history and my travels.  It is a hobby that teaches me patience, and I get to give them away as gifts for birthdays and holidays.</p>
