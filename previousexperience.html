      <h3>Server</h3>
        <p>I worked as a server for different types of restaurants in Salt Lake
          City and New York City.  I think servers deserve a degree in
          psychology after a few years of serving.  You really learn a lot about
          different the culture of a city, and about the human race as a
          whole.</p>

      <h3>ESL Teacher</h3>
        <p>I worked as an English Language teacher in South America
          for about 3 years.  It was a fun job! I enjoyed watching my students
          start from abosolutly no English to being able to speak in full
          sentences within a few months.</p>

      <h3>Social Studies Teacher</h3>
        <p>I taught grades 6-10 social studies for three years in the United
          Arab Emirates. The job was very rewarding, however there are many loop
          holes that teachers are constantly jumping through. It was an amazing
          experience, but I am taking an LOA from teaching for now. </p>
